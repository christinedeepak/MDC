        <p> Let me introduce you to my wonderful family. First, there’s my father, Deepak George, a truly inspiring figure in my life. 
            He’s hardworking, always putting his heart into whatever he does. His calm demeanor and sharp mind make him 
            a great problem-solver, and he’s the one I turn to for advice whenever I need it. <br><br>
        
            Then there’s my mother, Anila John, who brings warmth and light to everything she touches. She’s incredibly nurturing and has 
            a natural ability to make everyone feel loved and supported. Her sense of humor and kindness brighten up any room, 
            and she’s the glue that holds our family together. and I’ve always learned so much from her both in terms of life 
            lessons and personal growth.<br><br>

            Lastly, Catherine Deepak, my sister is the one who adds so much energy and fun to our family. She’s a bundle of joy, always ready to 
            share a laugh and offer a helping hand. Despite our occasional disagreements, we share an unbreakable bond and have a 
            lot in common. Together, we make a team that’s always ready for any adventure.</p>
