        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p>Family is the foundation of who I am. My father's name is Deepak George. He is a teacher.
            My mother's name is Anila John. She is working with NPOL. My sister's name is Catherine Deepak.
            She is doing her high school at Bhavans Varuna Vidyalaya. They have always supported and encouraged me 
            through every step of my journey. Growing up in a loving and close-knit family has taught
            me the values of kindness, respect, and perseverance. My parents and sister inspire me daily 
            with their strength and wisdom. Sharing my achievements and challenges with them has made my 
            experiences more meaningful. This section is dedicated to the people who have shaped my life and 
            continue to motivate me to grow. Iâ€™m grateful for their unconditional love and constant support.</p>
